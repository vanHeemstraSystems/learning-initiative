# Master Computing

We base our Initiative: Master Computing on Planning a [Minimum Viable Nothing (MVN)](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/minimum-viable-nothing).

At the very beginning, you should have identified a need as to why the product (i.e., good or service) should exist. This could be an organizational need or a customer need that addresses a current gap.

## 1. Identify and understand the **Business Needs**.

### a) Determine the **long-term goal** of the product (i.e., good or service) and write it down.

The long-term goal of mastering computing is to increase efficiency (through automation) and effectiveness of activities.

### b) Answer the question "**Why are we doing this project?**"

The reason for mastering computing is to increase efficiency (through automation) and effectiveness of activities.

### c) Identify the **success criteria** that will indicate whether or not the product (i.e., good or service) is successful.

[If you master something, you learn how to do it properly or you succeed in understanding it completely.](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/master-a-subject#:~:text=If%20you%20master%20something%2C%20you,succeed%20in%20understanding%20it%20completely.) 

Hence, mastering computing has been successful if we either ```learn how to do it properly``` or we ```succeed in understanding it completely```.
